Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at University of Maryland studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I am currently interning at the Collective Dynamics and Control Lab at UMD, as well as working on personal projects such as building machine learning algorithms from scratch and formalizing math in lean. I previously worked as a VR developer for the Earth Sciences department and led the Math Team at my high school.

I’m interested in everything related to mathematics and computer science, particularly areas that blur the lines between the two and have implications in both theory and practice, such as machine learning and algorithms. I’m also interested in Physics, Neuroscience, Economics, and occasionally ponder philosophy.

Feel free to reach out to me at `areg at terpmail dot umd dot edu` or find me on:
